Create a new project on GitHub or an app locally from a starter template.

## Overview

The Hummingbird project provides multiple entry points for getting started.

1. Create your own project that uses Hummingbird from a [starting template](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/template) to jump right in.
2. For a walk-through, explore and follow along the [Build a Todos Application](https://docs.hummingbird.codes/2.0/tutorials/todos) tutorial.
3. Take some time to explore the [Hummingbird Examples](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird-examples/), individual projects that use common patterns.

### Creating a project locally

Clone the starting template to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/hummingbird-project/template

Run the configure script provided to create a new folder and project inside:

    ./template/configure.sh MyNewProject

Change into the new project directory:

    cd MyNewProject

Then run your app:

    swift run

### Next Steps
