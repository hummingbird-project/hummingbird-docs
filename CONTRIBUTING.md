## Build Process

Hummingbird documentation is generated using Apple's docc documentation compiler. The build process is triggered from the script `scripts/build-docc.sh`. We don't use the docc plugin as currently there is no way to include links between modules while using the plugin. Documentation is built in a `docs` folder at the root of this project. It is best to run this script with the `HUMMINGBIRD_VERSION` environment variable set. This will ensure your documentation is placed in the correct folder for the current version of Hummingbird.

```
HUMMINGBIRD_VERSION=2.0 ./scripts/build-docc.sh
```
If you are editing documentation inside VSCdde, the default build task will run the code above.

## Testing changes

To test changes locally you can use [swift-web](https://github.com/adam-fowler/swift-web). Once it is installed run `swift web docs` to run a local HTTP file server with base directory set to the `docs` folder. You can then access the documentation in your web browser from `http://localhost:8001/hummingbird-docs/<version-number>/documentation/hummingbird`.

## Submitting changes

Changes should be submitting in a PR. In the PR please describe what the changes are and why they are needed. Also try to keep PRs to a minimal number of changes as possible. It is a lot easier to review multiple PRs of smaller changes than one big PR.

## Deploying changes

Currently v1 documentation is stored on the `main` branch and v2 documentation is stored on the `2.x.x` branch. As soon as a PR is merged into either of these branches the deploy process will begin and you should see your changes live in less than 10 minutes.
